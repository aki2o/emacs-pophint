  Do you know Vimperator/Keysnail of Firefox Addon?  
  If you don't know it, see a screenshot below.

  The hints that has a alphabet code are shown when you push a "f" key on Firefox like above.  
  Then, if you push the alphabet, you can jump the linked URL.

* Feature

*** Scalability

    This extension provides the following interface.  

    1. show the pop-up hints /SOMEWHERE/ on any window.
    2. do /ACTION/ to the point and text that is selected by user.

    You can add or change the /SOMEWHERE/ and /ACTION/ by definition /SOURCE/.  
    /SOURCE/ is Alist which has structure like =anything-source-...= of anything.el or =ac-source-...= of auto-complete.el.  

    And,  
    if you have a idea about /ACTION/ that are avilable for any /SOURCE/,  
    you can define the /ACTION/ for using anytime particularly.  
    For example, I think moving cursol to the point and copying the text are fit into the /ACTION/.  

    Some sources and actions are defined already in pophint-config.el.  
    For detail, see pophint-config.el section below.  

*** Switch source quickly

    If you execute the command that handle multiple source, the message is shown in minibuffer like the following.  

    [[file:image/switch_source.png][switch-source]]

    Then, you can switch a used source by pushing a "s" key.  
    And, you can customize the key binding.  

*** Show the pop-up hints on other window

    If you execute the command that show the pop-up hint in the situation that a frame has some windows,  
    the message is shown in minibuffer like the following.  

    [[file:image/switch_window.png][switch-window]]

    Then, you can switch a target window by pushing a "w" key.  
    And, you can customize the key binding.
